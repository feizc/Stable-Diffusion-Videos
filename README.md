# Video-Stable-Diffusion
Generate consistent videos with stable diffusion.
Instead of image latents interpolation, we use depth estimation to limit the content structure and inpainting version of stable diffusion to make video keep moving.

## How to use? 

This repository compatible with mostly environment and can be runned locally with pre-set ckpt.


## Examples

We provide some generated video examples.
